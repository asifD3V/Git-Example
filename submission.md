on this project, we started with the default branch, main, and created a new branch from it named develop. From the develop branch, we created two additional branches: feature/user_authentication and bugfix/registration-form. On the feature/user_authentication branch, we implemented a basic user authentication system along with a simple registration form. On the bugfix/registration-form branch, we pulled the code from feature/user_authentication and made updates to the registration formâ€™s design and styles for improved appearance. To simulate conflicts, we intentionally made overlapping changes to the registration form in both branches. The conflicts were resolved using GitHub's conflict resolution interface. After resolving the conflicts, the bugfix/registration-form branch was merged into feature/user_authentication via a pull request on GitHub. Subsequently, the updated feature/user_authentication branch was merged into develop, and finally, develop was merged into main. This process successfully demonstrated the use of a branching workflow, conflict resolution, and GitHub pull requests to update the project codebase in an organized and controlled manner.
